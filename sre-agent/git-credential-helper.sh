# Returns the sandbox JWT as a Basic auth password. The credential-resolver's
# /git/ proxy validates the JWT and injects real GitHub credentials when
# forwarding to github.com. This way, actual GitHub tokens never reach the
# sandbox — only the JWT (which the sandbox already possesses) is used.
#
# Git calls this script with "get" when it needs credentials.
# Protocol: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials#_custom_helpers

# Only handle "get" requests (not "store" or "erase")
