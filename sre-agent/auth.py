"""JWT generation for sandbox credential proxy.

This module handles server-side JWT generation. The credential-resolver
service has its own jwt_auth.py for validation (they're separate Docker images).

Sandboxes are untrusted - they could execute malicious code via prompt injection.
JWT ensures credential-resolver only provides credentials to legitimate sandboxes
by cryptographically binding tenant/team context to the sandbox identity.

Flow:
1. Server generates JWT with tenant_id, team_id, sandbox_name when creating sandbox
2. JWT is embedded in per-sandbox Envoy ConfigMap as a static header
3. Envoy adds x-sandbox-jwt header to all ext_authz requests
4. Credential-resolver validates JWT and extracts tenant/team (ignores spoofed headers)

Note: JWT validation is in credential-proxy/src/credential_resolver/jwt_auth.py
