## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Help us fix it:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the bug report template** when creating a new issue
3. **Include details**: steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, logs, environment info
4. **Add labels** if you can (bug, high-priority, etc.)

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea? We'd love to hear it:

1. **Check existing feature requests** in [Discussions](https://github.com/swapnildahiphale/OpenSRE/discussions)
2. **Open a discussion** in the Ideas category before creating an issue
3. **Explain the use case** and why it matters for incident response
4. **Consider the scope** — does this fit OpenSRE's mission?

### Contributing Code

Look for issues labeled:
- `good first issue` — beginner-friendly tasks
- `help wanted` — we'd love community contributions here
- `documentation` — help improve our docs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** with `uv` (recommended) or `pip`
- **Docker & Docker Compose** for local development
- **Node.js 18+** for the web frontend
- **PostgreSQL 16+** (or use Docker)

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swapnildahiphale/OpenSRE.git
cd opensre
```

2. **Set up environment**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (see .env.example for all options)
```

3. **Start the local dev stack**

```bash
make dev
# Starts Postgres, config-service, credential-resolver, envoy, sre-agent
# Migrations run automatically
```

4. **Run the web UI** (separate terminal)

```bash
cd web_ui && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

5. **Run tests**

```bash
pytest                          # Backend tests
cd web_ui && pnpm test         # Frontend tests
```

See [DEVELOPMENT_KNOWLEDGE.md](DEVELOPMENT_KNOWLEDGE.md) for detailed architecture and development guide.

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `main` — stable, production-ready code
- `develop` — integration branch for features
- `feature/your-feature` — your feature branch
- `fix/your-fix` — bug fix branch

### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test locally**

```bash
pytest                                    # Run all tests
pytest tests/test_your_feature.py        # Run specific tests
ruff check .                              # Lint
```

4. **Commit with clear messages**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add alert correlation for Datadog"
```

Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat:` — new feature
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation changes
- `refactor:` — code refactoring
- `test:` — adding/updating tests
- `chore:` — maintenance tasks

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Tests pass locally (`pytest`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`black .` and `ruff check .`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional commits
- [ ] Branch is up to date with `main`

### Submitting Your PR

1. **Push your branch**

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link related issues (`Closes #123`)
   - Add screenshots/videos for UI changes

3. **Respond to feedback**
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Push changes to the same branch
   - Re-request review when ready

### Review Process

- PRs require **at least one approval** from a maintainer
- CI checks must pass (tests, linting, type checking)
- For large changes, expect multiple review rounds
- We aim to review PRs within 2-3 business days

## Style Guidelines

### Python

- **Formatting**: Use `black` (line length 100)
- **Linting**: Use `ruff` with project config
- **Type hints**: Required for public APIs
- **Docstrings**: Use Google style for functions/classes

```python
def correlate_alerts(alerts: list[Alert], threshold: float = 0.8) -> list[AlertGroup]:
    """Correlate alerts using temporal and semantic similarity.

    Args:
        alerts: List of alerts to correlate
        threshold: Similarity threshold (0.0 to 1.0)

    Returns:
        List of correlated alert groups
    """
    pass
```

### TypeScript/React

- **Formatting**: Use Prettier
- **Linting**: Use ESLint with project config
- **Components**: Functional components with TypeScript
- **State**: Use React hooks, avoid class components

### Git Commit Messages

- Start with a conventional commit type
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Use present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Reference issues/PRs in body

```
feat: add Prometheus alert correlation

- Implement temporal correlation algorithm
- Add semantic similarity using embeddings
- Include tests for edge cases

Closes #123
```
